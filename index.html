      About myself
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
      my name is Fanli Qu, you can also call me Fanny. I graduated as a business student a long time ago and then worked in a bank, my family moved to the US at the end of 2017 and then our child was born soon after. Now that my child is 4 years old and I have been a full-time housewife for almost 5 years, I am very eager to learn something new and find a new job.

      Why I choose this course
    </h2>
    <p class="text">
      I finished my study for data science and big data in 2022. Data is something related to my previous experience, but this course is completely new for me. Because I have always had a passion for writing code and dealing with computers, but because of my previous major and work, I have not been involved in this area. Now I finally have the opportunity to learn something that I have been interested in for a long time. At the same time, I also want to learn this course and finally make something interesting of my own.
